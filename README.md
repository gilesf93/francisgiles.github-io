# About Me
Hi, my name is **Francis**!  

Three of my _favorite hobbies_ are 
* Traveling
* Watching horror movies
* Spending time with my family  

I’m a homebody as well—I love the comfort of being at home most of the time. But when it’s time for a vacation, I’m all in! One of my absolute favorite things to do is travel—it's been a passion of mine ever since I went on my very first cruise to Mexico. I fell in love with the experience so much that I decided to become a travel agent! There’s a quote by _**Hans Christian Andersen**_ that really speaks to me: 
> "_To travel is to live_".  

It’s so true—because until you actually get out there and explore the world, you never really know what you’re missing.  
One day, I hope to become a _**Software Developer/Engineer**_. I’ve been into computers since I was about 11 or 12, and looking back, I didn’t even realize I was already doing a bit of coding as a kid. I’ve always been the “computer repair” type—not because I had to be, but because I genuinely loved being on the computer. I wanted to make sure it always worked right so I could keep exploring and learning more.
